Follow up for "Unique Paths":

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.

For example,
There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.

>[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]

The total number of unique paths is 2.


C++
```
class Solution {
public:

    int uniquePathsWithObstacles(vector<vector<int>>& obstacleGrid) {
        int m = obstacleGrid.size(),n=obstacleGrid[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m+1,vector<int>(n+1,0));
        dp[m-1][n]=1;
        for(int i = m-1;i>=0;i--){
            for(int j=n-1;j>=0;j--){
                if(obstacleGrid[i][j]==1){
                    dp[i][j] = 0;
                }else{
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j]+dp[i][j+1];
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[0][0];
    }
};
```
